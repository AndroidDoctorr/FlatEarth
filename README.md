# Flat Earth Simulation

This is a Unity project that uses the Steam VR library to simulate a Flat Earth in a VR environment. I have not set up key bindings, it just uses the default for SteamVR.

If you can't get this to work, it should be pretty easy to just copy the assets to your own VR project.
